       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p>We may share personal information as follows:</p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p>• Third-Party Service Providers.&nbsp; We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf and to help us manage our business activities.&nbsp; For example, we may engage third parties to assist with procurement, manufacturing, warehousing, packaging, shipping, data storage and data analysis, billing and payment processing, customer support, and other activities.&nbsp; We may share personal information with these parties to enable them to perform their functions, but we do not permit them to use your personal information for other purposes.</p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p>• Business Transfers.&nbsp; As we continue to develop our business, we might buy or sell assets.&nbsp; In these types of transactions, User information is often one of the business assets that is transferred.&nbsp; In addition, if Company or its assets are acquired, or if Company undergoes a financing, merger or similar transaction, or goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, User information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred to a third party.&nbsp; You acknowledge that such transfer may occur and that any acquirer of Company or its assets may continue to use your personal information as described in this Policy.</p>

       <p>&nbsp;</p>

       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p>In particular, we understand that some Users may have concerns about use of credit cards to purchase Company products and services online.&nbsp; For orders placed on our Site, we use a technology that automatically encrypts credit card data while information is transmitted over the internet, provided that your browser supports the Secure Socket Layer protocol (SSL).&nbsp; We do not store your complete credit card number or security code in our records, and only keep the last 4 digits and the expiration date if needed for verification or subsequent purchases.&nbsp; Only the last 4 digits of your credit card will be displayed on any receipt or purchase confirmation.</p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>

       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p>Despite your and our efforts and any safeguards we may put in place, you should be aware that no form of data storage and transmission, whether in physical or electronic form, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.&nbsp; Unauthorized access, hardware or software weaknesses or failures, and other factors may compromise the security of personal information.&nbsp; As a result, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Company, and you do so at your own risk.&nbsp; There is also no guarantee that your personal information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed.&nbsp; If we learn of a security breach of our data transmission or storage systems we may attempt to notify you electronically or post a notice on the Site so that you can take protective steps.</p>
